TypeScript codebase with relaxed compiler strictness; React function components; routing via React Router; context providers for auth and notifications. Server uses Express routers per domain (auth, riskSheets, evaluations, actions, templates, analytics, tenants, users, notifications, audit, rag). Prisma schema enforces multi-tenant isolation; enums for roles/statuses. Security middlewares: Helmet, CORS; rate-limiting stricter in prod. CORS allows localhost dev origins. Error handlers return JSON with codes. Health endpoints standardized. Naming: descriptive variable names, early returns, pagination via query params page/limit. API client in src/lib/api.ts centralizes fetch with token management; VITE_API_URL defaults to /api to work with Vite proxy and reverse proxies.
