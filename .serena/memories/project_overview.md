The API exposes routes under /api/* and serves a SPA build in production. The project ships Dockerfiles for dev and production, docker-compose for local and prod stacks, and Azure deployment scripts. Health: /health, API test: /api/test. Default dev ports: backend 3002, frontend 5173 (alt 3003/3006 supported by scripts).
